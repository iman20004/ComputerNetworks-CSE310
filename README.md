## Learning Objectives
- Understanding of the conceptual foundations of computer network and layered protocol architecture.
- Understanding of different types of computer networks, such as WANs, LANs, wireless networks, and circuit-packet-switched networks, and between different paradigms of network applications (peer-to-peer/client-server).
- Understanding of the Internet architecture and the TCP/IP protocol suite, and details of representative protocols at the application, transport network and data link layers.
- Ability to use current network programming technology.
